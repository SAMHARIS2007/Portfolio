                <h3>Undergraduate Degree</h3>
                <p>I am currently pursuing my undergraduate degree in Computer Science and Engineering (CSE) at the
                Rajalakshmi Institute of Technology (RIT). This program has provided me with a robust foundation 
                in both theoretical concepts and practical applications within the field of computer science. I 
                have been actively engaged in coursework that spans areas such as algorithms, programming languages,
                database management, and software engineering. RIT's emphasis on hands-on learning and innovative 
                research opportunities has allowed me to collaborate with peers and faculty on projects that explore 
                cutting-edge technologies. I am excited to continue my academic journey at RIT, where I am developing 
                the skills necessary to thrive in the dynamic and ever-evolving field of technology."</p>
